# Automate the Boring Stuff
**Internal Assessment Resource**

## Introduction/Kupu Arataki

You are going to develop a python program, that automates a task for either yourself or for a chosen audience. This assessment activity requires you to plan, trial, test and develop the program. You will utilise an iterative development process to help you make informed decisions throughout the coding, testing and trialling of your program and show on-going refinement to improve the functionality and quality of your program.

You will be assessed on how effectively you plan your development, decompose the problem into smaller components, and test and refine your program so that it is a high-quality response to the task (e.g. well-structured, logical, flexible, robust and comprehensively tested).

When planning and developing your program, you must ensure your program uses:

- variables storing at least two different data types (e.g. numeric, text, Boolean)
- sequence, selection and iteration control structures
- input from a user, sensors, or other external source and produces output

AND includes one or more of:

- data stored in collections (e.g. lists arrays, dictionaries)
- user-defined methods, functions or procedures.

You must use sensible naming conventions and code commenting that describes code function and behaviour. Your program should be comprehensively tested and debugged in an organised manner.

> **You will have approximately 6 weeks to iteratively plan, develop, trial and test your program.** 


## Task/Hei Mahi

Your program can complete the task of your choice provided that it is suitable for your chosen audience and does not violate the relevant implications.

You might consider making any of the followingâ€¦


>- A webscraper that tracks and compares prices of a product across multiple websites
>- A program that emails the schedule out to your group or sports team each week
>- A program that removes all of the spaces in the filenames of your computer
>- A word to text file converter that will convert all files in a directory
>- A shortcut that will open the browser and log you on to a website
>- Collect weather forecasts for several campsites or hiking trails to see which one will have the best weather.
>- A program that adds a watermark to all photos that you have taken
>- Automate ordering groceries for click and collect
>- A program that finds the largest files in a directory
>- A todo list that a user can add and remove tasks from
>- A quiz program that retrives questions from an API
>- Any other task with the approval of your teacher

### You need to think about:

- Who your program is for
- What user inputs you will need
- How the questions and answers will be stored.
- How you will give feedback to the user.

### Planning: You must:

- Plan how you will develop your program by decomposing the problem into smaller components/sub components
- Create a test plan that allows you to confirm that your program works for expected and relevant boundary cases

### Developing and testing: You must

- Try various options when creating your program. You should choose the options which work best and provide evidence of your trialing.
- Comment your code.
- Code, test, and debug each component/sub-component before moving on. Create a new version of your program for each iteration.
- Systematically test your code (follow your test plan). Include screenshots (or video evidence) showing that your program's output matches the plan's expected values and has been tested with relevant boundary cases.

### Additional Evidence

Provide evidence to show how you have addressed relevant implications, for example:

- how your program will be suitable for your chosen user.
- how you will honored copyright
- how you will make sure that your program has taken into account relevant HCI principles.

## Hand In:

- Your plan / testing evidence
- All the versions of your program.
- Sprint documents for each 2 week period.
