# Internal assessment resource Digital Technologies/Hangarau Matihiko Achievement Standard 91883 and 91884

**Internal Assessment Resource**

**Achievement standard:** AS91883 and AS91884

**Standard title:** Develop a computer program (4 credits)

Use basic iterative processes to develop a digital outcome (6 credits)

**Credits:** 10

**Resource title:** Automate The Boring Stuff

## Teacher/Kaiako Guidelines

The following guidelines are supplied to support teachers/kaiako to carry out valid and consistent assessment using this internal assessment resource.

Teachers/kaiako need to be very familiar with the outcome being assessed by the achievement standard/s. The achievement criteria and the explanatory notes contain information, definitions, and requirements that are crucial when interpreting the standard and assessing students/ākonga against it.

## Context/Te Horopaki

This assessment activity requires students to develop a computer program that is suitable for the intended audience. Students should demonstrate the use of basic iterative processes to plan, trial, and test their computer program.

During this process, students should develop a refined computer program and improve its quality in an on-going manner. They need to ensure that they

- Use appropriate tools and techniques
- Test the outcome thoroughly
- Describe and address any implications and end-user considerations.

Please see the student task for more details.

## Conditions/Ngā Tikanga

Where a group approach is used, the teacher needs to ensure that there is opportunity for each student to provide evidence for all aspects of the standards.

The 10 credits for the achievement standards indicates that approximately 100 hours needs to be allocated for teaching, learning (in and out of the classroom) and assessment in a programme of study. Schedule regular progress checks with the students during this activity.

## Resource requirements/Ngā Rauemi

Students will need access to computers running Python and word processing software to allow them to complete the required documentation.

# Teacher Support information

NB: The teaching and learning of the knowledge, concepts and skills required to prepare students for this assessment, plus the assessment itself, would occupy a major part of the year&#39;s programme. The total of 10 credits for assessment indicates that approximately 100 hours of teaching/learning (in and out of class) and assessment will be required – about half the year&#39;s programme.

### Planning:

Students should plan how they will develop their computer program.

The planning should include research into issues regarding their chosen task (e.g. what aspects of the task take the most time and are most easily automated, what services, APIs exist to help complete the task) Their planning should also include evidence of breaking down the project into components that need to be included in their outcome. For example, when developing a program that finds the best weather for local hiking trails, the components could include, getting the users location, getting hiking trails within a given distance, getting weather forecasts for those locations etc. This could involve using programming techniques, the use of exceptions where required, loops to replace repeated code, functions, variables, collections and various user interface elements.

Planning should be undertaken in a manner that suits the outcome and could include sketches, wireframes, storyboards, flow-diagrams or mock-ups. Students may use online interactive or collaborative planning tools.

### Trialling:

Students should trial the components to be included and refine their outcome based on evidence of their trialling. Students should also provide evidence that they have planned out use cases to test the outcome and carry out testing iteratively to improve and refine and their outcome. The final outcome should include evidence that the student has recognised, described and addressed a range of relevant implications and end-user considerations.

### Outcome:

Students will produce an individual computer program that is appropriate for the teaching and learning programme. Teachers should ensure the rigor of the outcome is appropriate for Level 6 of the NZ Curriculum (e.g. has not been produced through simple modification of pre-designed templates and/or drag and drop WYSIWYG applications). The computer program that the student is being assessed on should be original coding, which has been developed by the student. However, they may also incorporate other open-source or royalty-free media that they have not developed, as appropriate to the outcome. For example, they may include an open-source or royalty-free sound track or images that they have not developed but have the permission (or appropriate license type) to include in the outcome.
